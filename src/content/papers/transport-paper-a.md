## What's this paper about?
Big transportation projects can generate measurable productivity gains, not just travel-time savings.

The core question is whether standard project evaluation misses broader productivity effects that matter for long-run growth and welfare.

## How we studied it and what we found
This paper develops and applies an urban transportation-economics framework to estimate productivity impacts from major network investments, instead of stopping at direct mobility metrics.

- Benefits are broader than commute-time improvements.
- Productivity channels can materially affect total project value.
- Ignoring these channels can understate returns from major infrastructure investments.

## Why you should care
If appraisal frameworks only count narrow travel metrics, decision-makers may underinvest in projects with large economy-wide payoffs. This paper supports a more complete cost-benefit lens for major urban transport policy.
