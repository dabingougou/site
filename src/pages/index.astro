      <p>
        Consider this the "About Me" page that spilled into the rest of a website. I put my projects, papers, notes, and experiments here, usually after too much coffee and just enough second guessing. I am a husband, father, and son. I live in Victoria, BC, Canada. I also love music with a good guitar sound in it. I also like tinkering with Raspberry Pi. One recent project is hosting a WireGuard setup for friends who need secure access.

      <p>
        I trained as a research economist, now work as a government economist, and spend a lot of my time doing data science.
