summary: "Shows that road-improvement effects on vehicle miles traveled are heterogeneous across metro areas, so one-size-fits-all policy assumptions can mislead planning."

## What's this paper about?
Road improvements do not affect driving the same way everywhere; metro context matters a lot.

The key question is how road improvements change vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and why estimated effects vary so much across metropolitan areas.

## How we studied it and what we found
The paper estimates heterogeneous metro-level VMT responses after road improvements, with a focus on how urban form and local context change the size and direction of effects.

- Average effects hide substantial between-metro variation.
- Some metros show stronger induced-demand patterns than others.
- Policy design should account for local context, not rely on a single national elasticity.

## Why you should care
Transportation planning and emissions strategy depend on realistic VMT responses. A heterogeneity-aware approach improves project evaluation, forecasting, and local policy design.
