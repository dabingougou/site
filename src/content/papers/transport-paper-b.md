summary: "Shows that road-improvement effects on vehicle miles traveled are heterogeneous across metro areas, so one-size-fits-all policy assumptions can mislead planning."

## One-line takeaway
Road improvements do not affect driving the same way everywhere; metro context matters a lot.

## Question
How do road improvements change vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and why do estimated effects differ so much across metropolitan areas?

## Method
The paper analyzes metro-level differences and estimates heterogeneous responses in VMT after road improvements, focusing on how urban form and local conditions change the magnitude/direction of effects.

## Main findings (plain English)
- Average effects hide substantial between-metro variation.
- Some metros show stronger induced-demand patterns than others.
- Policy design should account for local context, not rely on a single national elasticity.

## Why this matters
Transportation planning and emissions strategy depend on realistic VMT responses. A heterogeneity-aware approach improves project evaluation, forecasting, and local policy design.
