## One-line takeaway
Big transportation projects can generate measurable productivity gains, not just travel-time savings.

## Question
When governments evaluate urban transportation megaprojects, are they missing broader productivity effects that matter for long-run welfare and growth?

## Method
This paper develops and applies an urban transportation-economics framework to estimate productivity impacts linked to major network investments. It connects transport system changes to wider economic outcomes rather than stopping at direct mobility metrics.

## Main findings (plain English)
- Benefits are broader than commute-time improvements.
- Productivity channels can materially affect total project value.
- Ignoring these channels can understate returns from major infrastructure investments.

## Why this matters
If appraisal frameworks only count narrow travel metrics, decision-makers may underinvest in projects with large economy-wide payoffs. This paper supports a more complete cost-benefit lens for major urban transport policy.
